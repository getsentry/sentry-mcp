/**
 * Check Patched Dependency Versions
 *
 * Verifies that pnpm patchedDependencies target versions match installed versions.
 * Name-only keys in patchedDependencies (pnpm 10+ catalog style) apply patches
 * to whatever version resolves. If the installed version doesn't match the
 * patch file's target version, the patch may silently fail to apply.
 *
 * Mismatches are surfaced as warnings (not hard failures) because pnpm 10
 * name-only keys intentionally support version-agnostic patching — patches
 * often apply cleanly across minor/patch bumps. The warning ensures engineers
 * notice and can regenerate the patch if needed.
 *
 * Beyond version matching, this script runs CONTENT assertions that verify a
 * patch's *effect* is actually present in the installed package. This guards
 * against a class of silent failure: when a dependency is bumped and the patch
 * fails to apply (line-number/context drift), pnpm only WARNS and installs the
 * unpatched package — re-introducing whatever the patch fixed. A version-only
 * check would still pass in that case, so content assertions are the real
 * safety net.
 *
 * Known-fragile patch — @stricli/core (`-H` alias):
 *   The @stricli/core patch frees the `-H` short alias (Stricli hardcodes it
 *   for `--help-all`) so the `api` command can use `-H` for `--header`,
 *   gh-style. The patch edits exact line-context in BOTH `dist/index.js` (ESM)
 *   and `dist/index.cjs` (CJS). It WILL break on any @stricli/core version bump
 *   that shifts those lines. Upstreaming a config option for this is unlikely
 *   to be accepted, so the patch is a permanent maintenance cost: on every
 *   Stricli bump, expect to regenerate it (`pnpm patch @stricli/core`, reapply
 *   the four edits per file, `pnpm patch-commit`) and rename the patch file to
 *   the new version. This content check fails loudly if the bump silently
 *   dropped the patch.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   tsx script/check-patches.ts
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 - All patch versions match (or only non-critical warnings) and all
 *       content assertions pass
 *   1 - A patched package is missing entirely, OR a content assertion failed
 *       (patch did not apply to the installed package)

 * Resolve an installed package file to the copy THIS package actually uses.
 *
 * In a pnpm workspace, a transitive (unpatched) copy of a dependency can
 * coexist with the patched direct copy (e.g. an unpatched `@sentry/core`
 * pulled in via another dependency). A naive `node_modules/<pkg>` path may
 * point at the wrong copy. Using `require.resolve` rooted at this package
 * respects pnpm's per-package resolution and finds the patched copy the
 * `sentry` package links to.
 *
 * We resolve the package's MAIN entry (not its `package.json`, which many
 * packages exclude from their `exports` map) and then derive the package root
 * by truncating the resolved path at the package-name segment.
 *
 * The package root is the FIRST `<pkgName>/` segment that follows the last
 * `node_modules/` boundary in the resolved path. Anchoring on `node_modules/`
 * (rather than `lastIndexOf('/<pkgName>/')`) is important: a package that
 * vendors a nested copy of itself (e.g.
 * `.../node_modules/@scope/pkg/vendor/@scope/pkg/index.js`) would otherwise
 * truncate at the wrong, inner segment.

 * excludes them from the bundle. They edit bundler-generated barrels and are
 * therefore especially prone to silent context drift on a version bump. Each
 * marker is a re-export the patch removes (present in the pristine package,
 * absent once patched); its presence means the strip did NOT apply and the
 * bundle will re-bloat with the AI integrations — re-introducing the dangling

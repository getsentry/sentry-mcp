## Coverage matrix

| Dimension | Coverage status | Sources | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Released spec baseline | complete | tools spec, schema, lifecycle, server overview | Latest released baseline confirmed as `2025-11-25` |
| Lifecycle and capability negotiation | complete | lifecycle spec, server overview | Includes initialize, initialized, claimed capabilities, and control hierarchy |
| Tools and structured output | complete | tools spec, schema, local server-test example | Expanded beyond hints into titles, icons, schemas, execution metadata, and tool-result semantics |
| Prompts and resources | complete | server overview plus released spec synthesis | Added explicit audit branches even when a repo only implements tools today |
| Transport, auth, and security | complete | authorization spec, security best practices | Separated `stdio` from HTTP-specific checks |
| Version and draft variance | complete | released changelog, draft changelog | Added watchpoints so the skill does not over-enforce unreleased behavior |
| Repo-local compatibility rules | complete | adding-tools, quality-checks, local tests | Kept the skill generic while preserving local generation and validation expectations |

## Decisions

1. Keep the skill generic and portable; do not hardcode project-specific commands, paths, or mutation inventories into `SKILL.md`.
2. Expand the audit from tool hints alone to the full MCP surface the repo may expose: lifecycle, capabilities, tools, prompts, resources, transports, auth, security, and version drift.
3. Default to the latest released MCP spec when a repo does not pin an older version.
4. Treat draft and SEP content as watchpoints unless the repo explicitly opts into draft compatibility.
5. Prefer exported wire behavior over local declarations whenever frameworks can transform metadata before clients see it.

## Open gaps

1. The security best-practices guide is not version-pinned, so re-check it when the MCP site updates its threat model guidance.
2. Prompt- and resource-specific released spec pages can be added on the next revision if this skill needs even deeper prompt or resource troubleshooting examples.

## Stopping rationale

Additional retrieval would have been low-yield for this revision. The current source pack covers:

1. the latest released MCP wire contract
2. release and draft version drift
3. security and authorization guidance
4. repo-local compatibility rules
5. workflow-process authoring requirements

That was enough to rewrite `mcp-audit` into a broader protocol audit without inventing non-authoritative requirements.

## Changelog

- 2026-04-21: Created `mcp-audit` as a generic workflow-process skill for MCP metadata and compatibility audits.
- 2026-04-21: Expanded the skill from a narrow hint audit into a broader released-spec protocol audit covering lifecycle, capabilities, tools, prompts, resources, transports, auth, security, and version drift.

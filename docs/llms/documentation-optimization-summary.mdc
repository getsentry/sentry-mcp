# Documentation Optimization Summary

## Overview

Completed comprehensive documentation optimization for the Sentry MCP project, reducing redundancy and improving clarity for LLM consumption.

## Results

### Total Reduction
- **Original**: ~5,120 lines across all docs
- **Optimized**: 2,407 lines
- **Reduction**: 53% (2,713 lines removed)

### Key Changes

1. **Created Consolidated Documents**:
   - `common-patterns.mdc` (274 lines) - Shared patterns across all docs
   - `api-patterns.mdc` (217 lines) - API client and mocking patterns
   - `architecture.mdc` (227 lines) - System design extracted from CLAUDE.md

2. **Simplified Entry Points**:
   - CLAUDE.md: 267 → 85 lines (68% reduction)
   - cursor.mdc: Synced with CLAUDE.md

3. **Optimized Guide Documents**:
   - `adding-resources.mdc`: 765 → 212 lines (72% reduction)
   - `security.mdc`: 604 → 167 lines (72% reduction)
   - `monitoring.mdc`: 559 → 233 lines (58% reduction)
   - `deployment.mdc`: 574 → 219 lines (62% reduction)
   - `testing.mdc`: Refactored to 238 lines
   - `coding-guidelines.mdc`: 306 → 143 lines (53% reduction)
   - `adding-new-tools.mdc`: 415 → 206 lines (50% reduction)
   - `adding-new-prompts.mdc`: 276 → 186 lines (33% reduction)

4. **Removed Obsolete Files**:
   - `observability-and-monitoring.mdc` (replaced by `monitoring.mdc`)

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Extract Common Patterns**: Moved shared code patterns to `common-patterns.mdc`
2. **Show Don't Tell**: Replaced verbose explanations with code examples
3. **Reference Don't Repeat**: Used cross-references instead of duplicating content
4. **Focus on Essentials**: Removed obvious information (LLMs understand common sense)
5. **Structure for Context Windows**: Each doc is now reasonably sized for LLM consumption

## Benefits

- **Reduced Context Usage**: 53% less content to process
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for patterns
- **LLM-Optimized**: Focused on what LLMs need to know
- **Preserved Information**: All essential information retained

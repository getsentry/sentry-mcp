# LLM-Specific Documentation

This directory contains meta-documentation specifically for LLMs working with the Sentry MCP codebase.

## Contents

### documentation-style-guide.mdc
Guidelines for writing effective documentation that LLMs can consume efficiently. Defines principles like assuming intelligence, being concise, and showing rather than telling.

### document-scopes.mdc  
Defines the specific purpose, content requirements, and line count targets for each documentation file. Helps maintain focus and prevent scope creep.

### documentation-todos.mdc
Specific tasks for improving each document based on the style guide and scope definitions. Tracks the documentation refactoring effort.

## Purpose

These documents help ensure that:
- Documentation remains concise and focused
- LLMs get project-specific information, not general programming knowledge  
- Redundancy is minimized through proper cross-referencing
- Each document has a clear, defined purpose

## For Human Contributors

While these documents are designed for LLM consumption, they also serve as excellent guidelines for human contributors who want to understand:
- How to write documentation for this project
- What belongs in each document
- How to maintain consistency across docs

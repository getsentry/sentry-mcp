# Subpath-Based MCP Constraints Specification

## Overview

This specification describes the implementation of URL path-based constraints for the Sentry MCP server. Clients can connect to specific URL paths to restrict their MCP session to specific organizations and/or projects.

## Problem Statement

Currently, MCP sessions have access to all organizations and projects that the authenticated user can access. This creates security and usability concerns:
- Clients may accidentally access the wrong organization's data
- There's no way to scope a session to a specific project
- Multi-tenant environments need better isolation

## Solution

Support URL path-based constraints where clients connect to:
- `/mcp` - No constraints (backward compatible)
- `/mcp/{organizationSlug}` - Constrained to specific organization
- `/mcp/{organizationSlug}/{projectSlug}` - Constrained to organization and project

Same pattern for SSE endpoints:
- `/sse` - No constraints
- `/sse/{organizationSlug}` - Organization constraint
- `/sse/{organizationSlug}/{projectSlug}` - Full constraints

## Technical Implementation

### Key Discoveries

1. **OAuth Provider Path Matching**: The OAuth provider uses `startsWith` for path matching, meaning a handler registered for `/mcp` will also match `/mcp/org/project`

2. **Simple Context Defaults**: URL path constraints become default values in ServerContext, eliminating the need for complex validation infrastructure

3. **Session Persistence**: Constraints are stored in Durable Object storage and persist across requests

### Implementation Components

#### 1. Enhanced MCP Transport (`mcp-transport.ts`)
```typescript
class SentryMCPBase extends McpAgent {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    // Extract org/project from URL path using regex
    const pathMatch = url.pathname.match(/^\/(mcp|sse)(?:\/([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+))?(?:\/([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+))?$/);
    
    if (pathMatch?.[2]) {
      // Validate slugs for security
      if (this.isValidSlug(orgSlug) && (!projectSlug || this.isValidSlug(projectSlug))) {
        this.urlOrganizationSlug = orgSlug;
        this.urlProjectSlug = projectSlug;
        // Store in Durable Object storage for persistence
      }
    }
  }
  
  async init() {
    // URL path constraints override OAuth org (if present)
    const serverContext: ServerContext = {
      organizationSlug: this.urlOrganizationSlug || this.props.organizationSlug,
      projectSlug: this.urlProjectSlug,
      // ... other fields
    };
  }
  
  private isValidSlug(slug: string): boolean {
    // Security validation: reject malicious patterns, enforce length limits
  }
}
```

#### 2. Security Validation
```typescript
private isValidSlug(slug: string): boolean {
  // Reject empty strings, excessive length (100+ chars)
  // Reject path traversal (.. //) and URL patterns (:// %)
  // Require alphanumeric start/end characters
  // Allow only [a-zA-Z0-9._-] characters
}
```

## Interface

### URL Patterns
```
/mcp/{organizationSlug}/{projectSlug}
/mcp/{organizationSlug}
/mcp

/sse/{organizationSlug}/{projectSlug}
/sse/{organizationSlug}
/sse
```

### Context Integration
```typescript
interface ServerContext {
  organizationSlug: string | null;  // From URL path or OAuth
  projectSlug?: string | null;      // From URL path only
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Default Behavior
Constraints work as simple defaults in the server context:
- Tools that accept `organizationSlug` will use the URL constraint as default
- Tools that accept `projectSlug` will use the URL constraint as default
- No validation errors - tools just use the scoped defaults

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ URL parsing logic with security validation in `mcp-transport.ts`
- ✅ ServerContext integration with simple defaults
- ✅ Session-level constraint storage in Durable Object
- ✅ Support for both `/mcp` and `/sse` endpoints with constraints
- ✅ Security validation for slug patterns (alphanumeric, length limits, path traversal protection)
- ✅ Smoke tests for endpoint connectivity
- ✅ Client documentation updates

### How It Works

The implementation leverages the fact that the OAuth provider uses `startsWith` for path matching. This means a handler registered for `/mcp` will also match `/mcp/org/project`. We use this behavior to:

1. Parse the URL path directly in the MCP transport's `fetch()` method
2. Extract organization and project slugs using a secure regex pattern  
3. Validate slugs for security (reject malicious patterns, length limits)
4. Store constraints in Durable Object storage for hibernation persistence
5. Load constraints from storage in `init()` and use as ServerContext defaults

## Security Features

1. **Restrictive Regex**: Only allows `[a-zA-Z0-9._-]` characters in slugs
2. **Length Limits**: Maximum 100 characters per slug to prevent DoS
3. **Path Traversal Protection**: Rejects `..` and `//` patterns
4. **URL Injection Protection**: Rejects `://` and `%` encoding
5. **Format Validation**: Requires alphanumeric start/end characters

## Testing

```bash
# Run smoke tests against deployment
pnpm test  # in packages/smoke-tests

# Run smoke tests against local dev server
PREVIEW_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm test
```

## Migration

This feature is backward compatible. Existing clients connecting to `/mcp` or `/sse` will continue to work without constraints.

/**
 * Regression tests for the MCP path traversal class (VULN-2159, VULN-2174,
 * VULN-2450, VULN-2482).
 *
 * Unvalidated, unencoded Sentry resource IDs were interpolated into upstream REST
 * paths. Because `fetch` resolves `../` dot segments during URL parsing, an ID could
 * rewrite the path above the organization and project the server injects from the
 * session constraints, reaching other tenants with the granting user's credential.
 *
 * These drive tools through the same pipeline the server uses (constrained keys
 * stripped from the client-visible schema, Zod parse, constraints injected) and assert
 * on the outbound request URL, since the defect was only ever observable in the path
 * that actually left the process.
 *
 * The full bypass matrix lives in `api-client/api-path.test.ts`, against the function
 * that does the containment. These tests cover the wiring: that each reported sink
 * reaches that function.

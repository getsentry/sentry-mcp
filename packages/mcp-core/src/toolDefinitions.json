Checks if analysis already exists (instant results)\n2. Starts new AI analysis if needed (~2-5 minutes)\n3. Returns complete fix recommendations\n\n<examples>\n### User: \"What's causing this error? https://my-org.sentry.io/issues/PROJECT-1Z43\"\n\n```\nanalyze_issue_with_seer(issueUrl='https://my-org.sentry.io/issues/PROJECT-1Z43')\n```\n\n### User: \"Can you help me understand why this is failing in production?\"\n\n```\nanalyze_issue_with_seer(organizationSlug='my-organization', issueId='ERROR-456')\n```\n</examples>\n\n<hints>\n- Use this tool when you need deeper analysis beyond basic issue details\n- If the user provides an issueUrl, extract it and use that parameter alone\n- The analysis includes actual code snippets and fixes, not just error descriptions\n- Results are cached - subsequent calls return instantly\n</hints>",

 * Tool result packing policy

 * - `structuredContent` is the source of truth when present.
 * - `content` text is a compatibility view of that same answer.
 * - Never put unique product data in only one side. If both fields are present,
 *   they must be equivalent. Form-only differences (JSON vs pretty text of the
 *   same payload) are fine; a second answer that exists in only one field is a
 *   bug.
 * - Prefer `structuredResult(payload)` for data tools. The server generates
 *   `content` as pretty JSON of the same payload.
 * - Markdown-only tools should return markdown and omit `structuredContent`
 *   until they have a real structured payload. Do not attach sparse structured
 *   side-channels (for example suggestedActions alone) on top of markdown.

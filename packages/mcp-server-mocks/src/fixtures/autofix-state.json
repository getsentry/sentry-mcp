        "output_stream": "Let me summarize what I know about this issue:\n\n1. The error occurs in the `bottleById.ts` endpoint, with the error \"Bottle not found.\"\n2. The request is to `/trpc/bottlePriceList,bottleById` - which suggests that two TRPC procedures are being called in the same request.\n3. According to the error trace, the input ID is 16720, but the exception details show 3216 as the input value.\n4. The code in `bottleById.ts` tries to look up a bottle in two places:\n   - First in the main `bottles` table\n   - Then in the `bottleTombstones` table (which handles redirects for bottles that have been merged/moved)\n\nThe most significant clue is the discrepancy between the ID mentioned in the error (16720) and the ID in the exception details (3216). This suggests there's something fishy going on with how the IDs are being processed.\n\nGiven that the URL shows `bottlePriceList,bottleById`, this suggests a batched TRPC request where two procedures are being called simultaneously. The batched nature of TRPC calls might be relevant here.\n\nLet's think about potential root causes:\n\n1. **Data problem**: Neither bottle ID 16720 nor 3216 exists in the database.\n2. **Race condition**: The bottle might have been deleted between the two calls.\n3. **TRPC batching issue**: There might be a problem with how the batched request is handling the different IDs for the two procedures.\n4. **Input switching**: The ID is somehow being switched between the procedures.\n\nBased on the evidence, I think the most likely explanation is related to the TRPC batching. When the client makes a request to `/trpc/bottlePriceList,bottleById`, it's calling two procedures:\n- `bottlePriceList` with one ID (maybe 16720)\n- `bottleById` with another ID (3216)\n\nThe error is occurring in the `bottleById` procedure with ID 3216, but the overall request is being reported with ID 16720 (which might be from the `bottlePriceList` part of the batch).\n\nSince the exception is specifically coming from `bottleById.ts` with input 3216, the root cause is that there is no bottle with ID 3216 in the database (neither in `bottles` nor in `bottleTombstones`).\n\nThe confusing part is that the error message mentions 16720, which might be:\n1. A UI issue where the ID displayed doesn't match what's being requested\n2. A client-side issue where the wrong ID is being provided to `bottleById`\n3. A batching issue where the ID from one procedure is being displayed in the error for another\n\nGiven this analysis, the true root cause is: **The `bottleById` procedure is being called with ID 3216, but no bottle with that ID exists in the database.**\n\nThis is definitely a data consistency issue - either the bottle with ID 3216 was deleted without creating a tombstone, or the client is requesting a non-existent ID.# Root Cause Analysis: TRPCError: Bottle not found\n\nAfter examining all the available evidence, I can identify the true root cause of this issue:\n\n## Root Cause\n\n**The issue is related to a TRPC batch request inconsistency between the requested bottle ID and what's being processed.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on several key observations:\n\n1. The request is made to `/trpc/bottlePriceList,bottleById` - this is a batched TRPC request calling two procedures simultaneously.\n\n2. **Critical discrepancy**: The error message references bottle ID 16720, but the exception details show the procedure was actually processing ID 3216.\n\n3. Both procedures (`bottleById` and `bottlePriceList`) contain similar \"Bottle not found\" error checks, but the one that's triggering is in `bottleById.ts`.\n\n4. The `bottleById` procedure is attempting to find bottle ID 3216, not finding it in the main bottles table, then failing to find it in the tombstones table as well.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\n\nWhat's happening is:\n\n1. The client makes a batched request to both `bottlePriceList` and `bottleById` endpoints.\n\n2. Based on the URL and error, it appears that:\n   - The `bottlePriceList` procedure might be receiving ID 16720\n   - The `bottleById` procedure is receiving ID 3216\n\n3. When `bottleById` tries to process ID 3216, it can't find this bottle in the database or in tombstones, so it throws the \"Bottle not found\" error.\n\n4. The error reporting is showing the ID from the overall request (16720) while the actual failure is happening with a different ID (3216).\n\n## Why This Is Happening\n\nThis is likely either:\n\n1. **Client-side issue**: The client is passing the wrong ID to `bottleById` in the batched request\n2. **Data integrity issue**: Bottle ID 3216 may have been deleted without creating a tombstone entry\n3. **Parameter mixing**: The batched TRPC request might be incorrectly mapping parameters between the two procedures\n\nThe fact that two different IDs are involved (16720 and 3216) strongly suggests this is not a simple case of a missing bottle, but rather a data inconsistency or parameter handling issue in the batched request.\n\nTo fix this issue, you would need to:\n1. Check if bottle ID 3216 should exist in the database\n2. Verify how the client is forming the batched request and what IDs it's sending to each procedure\n3. Consider adding more detailed logging that shows the exact inputs to each procedure in batched requests",

        "output_stream": "Based on all the information I've gathered, I'm going to develop a clear fix for this issue. Let's summarize the core problem first:\n\n1. We have a TRPC batch request that calls both `bottlePriceList` and `bottleById` procedures in a single HTTP request.\n2. The error shows a discrepancy between the bottle ID in the error message (16720) and the ID being processed when the error occurred (3216).\n3. The `bottleById` procedure fails because it's trying to find bottle ID 3216, which doesn't exist in the database or in tombstones.\n\nThe most likely issue is a parameter mismatch in the batch TRPC request. When examining the client code and the trace, it seems like the client-side code is sending different bottle IDs to the two procedures incorrectly.\n\nLet's analyze the most probable causes and their solutions:\n\n1. **Client-side parameter mismatch**: The client might be configuring the batch request incorrectly, sending bottle ID 16720 to `bottlePriceList` and bottle ID 3216 to `bottleById`.\n\n2. **Server-side parameter confusion**: There could be some issue with how parameters are being mapped in batched TRPC requests on the server side.\n\n3. **Application-level logic issue**: The application might be assuming that both procedures should operate on the same bottle ID, but this assumption is being violated during batch requests.\n\nFrom the code snippets I've seen, the most likely issue is in the client-side code where the batch request is being constructed. The solution should ensure consistency in parameters across the batch request.\n\nSince we can see from traces that the client is attempting to fetch bottle details, and the frontend code shows that the `bottlePriceList` and `bottleById` are supposed to operate on the same bottle ID, I'm going to recommend a solution that ensures parameter consistency.\n\nThe most actionable and effective fix would be to ensure that both procedures receive the same bottle ID in the batch request. Let's outline that solution in detail:# Solution to Fix the \"Bottle not found\" TRPC Error\n\n## Root Cause\nThe issue stems from a parameter mismatch in TRPC batch requests. When a request is made to `/trpc/bottlePriceList,bottleById`, the procedures are receiving different bottle IDs:\n- `bottlePriceList` receives ID **16720**\n- `bottleById` receives ID **3216**\n\nThe error occurs because bottle ID **3216** doesn't exist in the database.\n\n## Solution Steps\n\n### 1. Fix the Client-Side Batch Request Configuration\n\nThe most direct solution is to ensure parameter consistency in the batch request. Based on the web app's bottle page implementation, both procedures should receive the same bottle ID.\n\n```typescript\n// In apps/web/src/app/(default)/bottles/[bottleId]/(tabs)/page.tsx\nexport default async function BottleDetails({\n  params: { bottleId },\n}: {\n  params: { bottleId: string };\n}) {\n  const trpcClient = await getTrpcClient();\n  \n  // PROBLEM: These are being called separately, potentially with different batching behavior\n  const bottle = await trpcClient.bottleById.fetch(Number(bottleId));\n  \n  // ...rest of the function\n}\n\n// In apps/web/src/app/(default)/bottles/[bottleId]/(tabs)/prices/page.tsx\nexport default async function BottlePrices({\n  params: { bottleId },\n}: {\n  params: { bottleId: string };\n}) {\n  const trpcClient = await getTrpcClient();\n  const priceList = await trpcClient.bottlePriceList.fetch({\n    bottle: Number(bottleId),\n  });\n  \n  // ...rest of the function\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Implement Proper Error Handling for Missing Bottles\n\nAdd graceful handling when a bottle isn't found, especially in the context of batch requests:\n\n```typescript\n// In apps/server/src/trpc/routes/bottleById.ts\nexport default publicProcedure.input(z.number()).query(async function ({\n  input,\n  ctx,\n}) {\n  try {\n    let [bottle] = await db.select().from(bottles).where(eq(bottles.id, input));\n\n    if (!bottle) {\n      // check for a tombstone\n      [bottle] = await db\n        .select({\n          ...getTableColumns(bottles),\n        })\n        .from(bottleTombstones)\n        .innerJoin(bottles, eq(bottleTombstones.newBottleId, bottles.id))\n        .where(eq(bottleTombstones.bottleId, input));\n      if (!bottle) {\n        throw new TRPCError({\n          message: `Bottle not found with ID: ${input}`,  // Include ID in error for better debugging\n          code: \"NOT_FOUND\",\n        });\n      }\n    }\n    \n    // Rest of the function...\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Log the error with context\n    console.error(`Error fetching bottle ID ${input}:`, error);\n    throw error;\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### 3. Update the Batch Request Implementation to Ensure Parameter Consistency\n\nThe most thorough solution is to modify how pages that need both bottle details and price data fetch their information:\n\n```typescript\n// In a shared utility function or component\nexport async function getBottleWithPrices(bottleId: number) {\n  const trpcClient = await getTrpcClient();\n  \n  // Use Promise.all to ensure both requests are part of the same batch\n  // and receive the same parameters\n  const [bottle, priceList] = await Promise.all([\n    trpcClient.bottleById.fetch(bottleId),\n    trpcClient.bottlePriceList.fetch({ bottle: bottleId }),\n  ]);\n  \n  return { bottle, priceList };\n}\n\n// Then in the page components:\nconst { bottle, priceList } = await getBottleWithPrices(Number(bottleId));\n```\n\n### 4. Add Debugging to TRPC Batch Requests\n\nTo prevent similar issues in the future, add better logging for TRPC batch requests:\n\n```typescript\n// In apps/server/src/trpc/index.ts\nexport const publicProcedure = t.procedure.use(sentryMiddleware).use(\n  t.middleware(async ({ ctx, next, path, input }) => {\n    // Log the procedure name and input for debugging\n    console.log(`TRPC procedure: ${path}, input:`, input);\n    \n    return next({\n      ctx,\n    });\n  })\n);\n```\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n1. **First implement solution #3** - Update how batch requests are made to ensure parameter consistency\n2. **Then implement solution #2** - Improve error messaging and handling\n3. **Consider solution #4** for monitoring and preventing future issues\n\nThis approach addresses the immediate problem while also improving the robustness of the application against similar issues in the future.",

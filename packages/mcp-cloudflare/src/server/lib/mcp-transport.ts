/**
 * MCP Transport Durable Object
 *
 * LIFECYCLE (based on McpAgent from agents library):
 *
 * 1. Durable Object Creation:
 *    - OAuth Provider validates token and extracts props (userId, accessToken, etc.)
 *    - DO is created with ID based on user (one DO instance per user)
 *    - init() is called ONCE when DO is created
 *    - fetch() is called for the first request
 *
 * 2. Subsequent Requests (same user):
 *    - Same DO instance is reused (persists in memory)
 *    - ONLY fetch() is called (init() is NOT called again)
 *    - DO stays alive between requests for ~30 seconds of inactivity
 *
 * 3. Hibernation:
 *    - After inactivity, DO hibernates (removed from memory)
 *    - State is persisted to storage
 *
 * 4. Wake from Hibernation:
 *    - When user reconnects after hibernation
 *    - init() is called again to restore state
 *    - fetch() is called for the request
 *
 * CONSTRAINT HANDLING - IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL TRADE-OFF:
 *
 * This implementation uses server reconfiguration when constraints change, which is
 * NOT IDEAL but necessary given the current architecture limitations:
 *
 * IDEAL: Each unique set of constraints (org/project) would have its own DO instance,
 * similar to how .mcp.json configurations work locally. This would provide:
 * - Immutable configuration per context
 * - Clear session boundaries
 * - No reconfiguration needed
 *
 * REALITY: We must reconfigure because:
 * 1. The OAuth provider creates DOs based on userId only (not constraints)
 * 2. The agents library controls DO creation via sessionId
 * 3. We cannot cleanly intercept DO creation without fragile hacks
 *
 * ATTEMPTED ALTERNATIVES (see git history):
 * - Constraint-based sessionId manipulation: Too fragile, depends on internals
 * - Multiple server instances per DO: Memory bloat
 * - Custom DO routing: Requires reimplementing MCP protocol handling
 *
 * CURRENT APPROACH:
 * - Detect constraint changes in fetch()
 * - Reconfigure the MCP server when constraints change (~10-50ms overhead)
 * - Store last constraints for hibernation recovery
 *
 * This is a pragmatic solution that:
 * - Works reliably with existing libraries
 * - Is maintainable and debuggable
 * - Has acceptable performance (users rarely switch contexts rapidly)
 * - Prevents state leakage between contexts (fresh server per reconfiguration)
 *
 * Props contain the authenticated user context from the OAuth flow.
 * These are encrypted and stored in the OAuth token, then provided
 * to the Durable Object as this.props on each request.
 * NOTE: Only store persistent user data in props (e.g., userId, accessToken).
 * Request-specific data like user agent should be captured per request.

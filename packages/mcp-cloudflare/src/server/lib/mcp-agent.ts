/**
 * Sentry MCP Agent - A Durable Object that provides Model Context Protocol access to Sentry.
 *
 * This class extends the Cloudflare agents library McpAgent to provide authenticated,
 * constraint-scoped access to Sentry's API through MCP tools and resources.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 *
 * Each MCP client connection creates a unique Durable Object instance via sessionId.
 * The agents library generates sessionIds based on the connection context, ensuring
 * that different constraint contexts (e.g., /mcp/org1/proj1 vs /mcp/org2/proj2)
 * get separate DO instances with immutable configurations.
 *
 * LIFECYCLE:
 *
 * 1. Connection: MCP client connects to URL like /mcp/sentry/my-project
 * 2. Authentication: OAuth flow provides user credentials and permissions
 * 3. DO Creation: Agents library creates DO with unique sessionId for this context
 * 4. Initialization: init() configures MCP server with user auth and URL constraints
 * 5. Request Handling: fetch() processes MCP protocol messages (tools, resources, prompts)
 * 6. Hibernation: DO persists state and hibernates after inactivity
 * 7. Recovery: init() restores state when DO wakes from hibernation
 *
 * CONSTRAINT SCOPING:
 *
 * URL paths like /mcp/sentry/my-project are parsed to extract organization and project
 * constraints. These constraints scope all Sentry API calls to the specific org/project
 * context, ensuring users can only access data they're authorized for within that scope.
 *
 * Static serve() methods extract constraints from URLs and mutate props before DO instantiation,
 * ensuring immutable constraint configuration throughout the DO's lifetime.
 *
 * AUTHENTICATION:
 *
 * User authentication flows through OAuth, with credentials stored in encrypted props
 * that persist across DO hibernation cycles. The DO uses these credentials to authenticate
 * all Sentry API requests on behalf of the MCP client.
 */

/**
 * Sentry MCP Agent - A Durable Object that provides Model Context Protocol access to Sentry.
 *
 * Following the pattern from the gist: this class extends McpAgent and mutates props
 * directly on first request to include URL-extracted constraints. Props are then immutable

# Package Management Requirements

## Package Installation and Updates

When making changes to package dependencies (installing, removing, or updating packages), you must:

1. Run `pnpm install` after any changes to `package.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`
2. Commit both the `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files together
3. Ensure all team members run `pnpm install` after pulling changes that modify dependencies

This ensures consistent dependency versions across all development environments and prevents issues with missing or mismatched packages.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install a new package
pnpm add <package-name>

# Remove a package
pnpm remove <package-name>

# Update packages
pnpm update

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install
```

Remember: Always run `pnpm install` after any changes to package dependencies to ensure your local environment stays in sync with the project's requirements.
